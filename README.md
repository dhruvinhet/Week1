# Solar Power Prediction Using Linear Regression Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting solar power generation using a Linear Regression model. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and building a predictive model to estimate solar power generation based on input parameters.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is stored in the file `Dataset/solarpowergeneration.csv`. It contains data related to solar power generation, including various influencing factors such as weather conditions and time of day.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical analysis are performed to understand the data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Data is preprocessed and relevant features are selected for the model.
4. **Model Building**: A Linear Regression model is implemented to predict solar power generation.
5. **Model Evaluation**: The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

## How to Run the Notebook
1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solar-power-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook solarpowerprediction.ipynb
   ```
5. Follow the steps in the notebook to execute the project.

## Results
The notebook provides insights and predictions for solar power generation based on the dataset. Visualizations are included to demonstrate the data patterns and model performance.
